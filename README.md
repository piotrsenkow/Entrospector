Two Bugs: 

1).GOT TO MAKE THE SWITCH TO PYTHON 3.5 BEFORE THE PROGRAM GETS BIGGER AND FUNCTIONS BREAK 

2).It only runs in Python 2.7.12 so to run it run the command in your terminal "python Entropy.py". If you try running it in python 3 you will get a "TypeError: object of type 'filter' has no len()"

3).Program breaks in menu when a string is put in. Will be easily fixed once I roll in python 3...
