# entrospector

# A research project in the works written for Dr. Brian Pickett, Loyola University Chicago.

Entrospector takes an input file of genes and their connections and creates a dictionary
that houses them.
Entrospector has the capability to check how many unique connections each gene has, allowing the user to specify a gene of interest and see how the network intereacts.
Entrospector also calculates an entropy score for individual genetic nodes and of the system as a whole.
GUI and a way to visualize the network as a connected graph coming soon!
